Born and raised in Tehran, I moved to Canada in 2022 to pursue higher level education. My academic interests lie in the conjunctions of machine learning, physics, and epistemology. I most particularly am fascinated by understanding creativity through both a cognitive and rbitrarily disciplinary view point.
Outside of Academics, I keep busy reading fiction, weight lifting, learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and performing, discovering and understanding music.
